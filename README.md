Chosen is a library for making long, unwieldy select boxes more user friendly.

### Fork Changes

I was looking for better integration of Chosen with Twitter Bootstrap. I found the solution from two forks:

 * https://github.com/gil/chosen : this fork will render chosen dropdown on page body, fixing display of dropdowns inside modals.
 * https://github.com/andriijas/chosen-bootstrap-fontawesome : this fork replaces sprites with Fontawesome, an fantastic font build for Bootstrap.

This fork is simply a merge of the two forks.
